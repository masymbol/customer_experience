"2097",3,"Hawaii DreamingAfter spending a long day on the Kaneohe Sandbar, trying to capture something spectacular, but to no avail, I was able to grab this from a very popular and very frequented lookout just before sunset. Â This image is special because of the light. Â It sits on the east side of the island, so everything you are seeing are behind a mountain, rarely does the color travel over in the clouds like this creating the &quot;perfect&quot; photo light. #sony Â  #shutterforcephotography Â  #a7r Â  #zeiss Â  #mefoto Â  #formatthitech Â  #makapuu Â  #oahu Â  #hawaii Â  #eastside Â  #rabbitisland Â  #seascape Â  #seascapephotography Â  #landscape Â  #landscapephotography Â  #pacific Â +ZEISS GroupÂ +Formatt-HitechÂ +SonyÂ +Landscape PhotographyÂ +Landscape Photography ShowÂ +LANDSCAPE PhotosÂ +Landscape Photography CommunityÂ ï»¿","https://plus.google.com/1.10199150154688e+20"
