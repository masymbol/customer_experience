"1","..:: Green Dolphin ::..I often have the honor of running group and individual workshops. One of the main things I stress is the importance of light. Without good light a photo will never reach its full potential. It is a blessing living on the east coast of Australia, being able to watch the sun rise each morning over the ocean. There is a small window of opportunity where the sun beams flawlessly through the waves, illuminating the sea spray in tints of gold. Hope you&#39;re all having a great weekend.Â http://williampatino.com/the-ancient-of-days-cathedral-rocks-kiama #surf  Â   #water  Â   #wave  Â   #explore  Â   #beauty  Â   #nature  Â   #photography  Â   #landscapephotography  Â   #naturephotography  Â   #beautiful  Â   #photographer  Â   #sunrise  Â   #seascape  Â   #seascapephotography  Â   #sony  Â +SonyÂ   #wollongong  Â   #illawarra  Â   #amazing  Â   #powerful  Â ï»¿"
