"2056",-2,"&quot;Our brains are busier than ever before. Weâre assaulted with facts, pseudo facts, jibber-jabber, and rumour, all posing as information. Trying to figure out what you need to know and what you can ignore is exhausting. At the same time, we are all doing more. Thirty years ago, travel agents made our airline and rail reservations, salespeople helped us find what we were looking for in shops, and professional typists or secretaries helped busy people with their correspondence. Now we do most of those things ourselves. We are doing the jobs of 10 different people while still trying to keep up with our lives, our children and parents, our friends, our careers, our hobbies, and our favourite TV shows.[...]But thereâs a fly in the ointment. Although we think weâre doing several things at once, multitasking, this is a powerful and diabolical illusion...our brains are ânot wired to multitask wellâ¦ When people think theyâre multitasking, theyâre actually just switching from one task to another very rapidly. And every time they do, thereâs a cognitive cost in doing so.â So weâre not actually keeping a lot of balls in the air like an expert juggler; weâre more like a bad amateur plate spinner, frantically switching from one task to another, ignoring the one that is not right in front of us but worried it will come crashing down any minute. Even though we think weâre getting a lot done, ironically, multitasking makes us demonstrably less efficient.&quot; #neuroscience Â  #socialnetworking Â  #email Â  #facebook Â  #twitter Â  #internet Â  #computing Â ï»¿","https://plus.google.com/1.02508728590352e+20"
