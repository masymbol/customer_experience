Computational linguists often work as members of interdisciplinary teams, including linguists (specifically trained in linguistics), language experts (persons with some level of ability in the languages relevant to a given project), and computer scientists. In general, computational linguistics draws upon the involvement of linguists, computer scientists, experts in artificial intelligence, mathematicians, logicians, philosophers, cognitive scientists, cognitive psychologists, #psycholinguists, anthropologists and neuroscientists, among others. #art #scienceofthearts #articulatelylinguistic #conscience #law #sindymaharaj #hinduvimana #echosoftime #son=per son in valueï»¿","https://plus.google.com/1.17352236516117e+20"

YEAHHH,.. and I heard that fear, discouragement, and the jealousy teams were planning on using whatever they can, to divide me,... to hold me down,.. and to stop me from having a new normal. I&#39;M SERIOUS...Its like, I seen them getting all geared up, greased up, and ready to block  me from refreshing myself, resetting my mind, and becoming a new expression of many old ideas. SMH... But I&#39;m not even gonna get caught up on being part of misery. I&#39;M READY FOR THEM....THATS RIGHT.. and what I want to know is, ... why would they even think, or wish for me to give up right now.... in the beginning...
