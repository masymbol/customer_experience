Computational linguists often work as members of interdisciplinary teams, including linguists (specifically trained in linguistics), language experts (persons with some level of ability in the languages relevant to a given project), and computer scientists. In general, computational linguistics draws upon the involvement of linguists, computer scientists, experts in artificial intelligence, mathematicians, logicians, philosophers, cognitive scientists, cognitive psychologists, #psycholinguists, anthropologists and neuroscientists, among others. #art #scienceofthearts #articulatelylinguistic #conscience #law #sindymaharaj #hinduvimana #echosoftime #son=per son in valueï»¿"

"2093",1,"Great day everyone, I run Desi&#39;s Hair, A Braid Training Academy, and DesiDesigns. . . So as y&#39;all know, I&#39;ve decided to start some new things in my journey this year, (OWWW, GO DESIREE!! SHMURDA DANCING..).....and I see the challenges have begun. YUP,...I&#39;m talking about the mixture of my enemies, gathering up, to hold me back from doing amazing things. UMM HMM.. since I&#39;ve decided to focus my energy on new goals and step into new experiences, they&#39;ve started looking at me with their spirits of unbelief and lining up their resources to distract me in the process of my purpose.. YEAHHH,.. and I heard that fear, discouragement, and the jealousy teams were planning on using whatever they can, to divide me,... to hold me down,.. and to stop me from having a new normal. I&#39;M SERIOUS...Its like, I seen them getting all geared up, greased up, and ready to block  me from refreshing myself, resetting my mind, and becoming a new expression of many old ideas. SMH... But I&#39;m not even gonna get caught up on being part of misery. I&#39;M READY FOR THEM....THATS RIGHT.. and what I want to know is, ... why would they even think, or wish for me to give up right now.... in the beginning... For real like..., DO THEY NOT KNOW I&#39;M TOUGHER THAN THAT...or TOUGH LIKE THAT...SHUUUUU,...I mean like,....I know I wasn&#39;t that great in math but I do know  that God&#39;s presence + my process(Ã10) = PROMISE. ..WINK WINK #I DON&#39;T MISTAKE MY DELAYS FOR BEING MY DESTINY, FOR DELAYED DOESN&#39;T MEAN DENIED...I LOOKED IT UP AND NOW I&#39;M KEEPING IT MOVING...*T.A..G!ï»¿"
