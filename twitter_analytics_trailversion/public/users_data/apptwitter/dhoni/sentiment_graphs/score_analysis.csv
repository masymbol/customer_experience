Patients in these hospitals reportedly were medicated against their will and forcibly subjected to electric shock treatment.âYet despite documented abuses in Chinese psychiatric institutions, the ankang facilities â which ironically translate as âpeace and health facilities [for the mentally ill]â â are not as widely known.They are so much more covered up that many veteran psychiatrists, lawyers specializing in the rights of the mentally ill, and criminal psychology professors have stated that they knew nothing about such facilities.Read more at :http://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2015/1/11/147930.html#HappyBirthdayZayn Â   #Monday  Â   #SwamiVivekananda #GoldenGlobes Â   #AliaBhatt  Â   #JacquelineFernandez #VibrantGujarat2015 Â   #HouseOfCards  Â   #France  Â   #GoBucks #CharlieHebdo Â   #AvengersAgeOfUltron  Â   #Offline  Â   #Patriots #aasodl Â   #HappyLohri  Â   #WWE  Â   #Dogs  Â   #Acura #FoxNewsFactsÂ   #Paris  Â   #GoBucks  Â   #Broncos  Â   #NAIAS #aasodlÂ   #ValentinesDay  Â Â   #Monday  Â   #FoxNewsFacts #DbzÂ   #CENTCOM  Â Â   #HongKong  Â   #Night  Â   #China  Â   #Travel  Â   #Peak  Â   #Tram  Â   #victoriaharbor  Â   #Offline   #TheInterview  Â   #LizardSquad  Â   #Friday  Â   #Indonesia  Â   #Bokeh  Â   #DoctorWho  Â   #BoxingDay  Â   #Bestof2014  Â   #TGIF  Â  Â   #SalmanKhan  Â  Â   #Caturday  Â  Â   #NewYear2015  Â  Â   #snowphotography  Â  Â   #Kerala  Â  Â   #SMS  Â  Â   #AUSvIND  Â  Â   #Flower  Â  Â  Â   #EXO  Â  Â   #Aambala   #DeniseMilani  Â   #LukeMilani  Â   #germanshepherd  Â   #gsd  Â Â Â  Â   #Christmas  Â   #dog  Â   #doglife  Â   #bestbuddies  Â   #love  Â   #animalfriends  Â   #SalmanKhan  Â   #Caturday  Â   #Kerala  Â   #NewYear2015  Â   #AUSvIND   #snowphotography  Â   #SMS  Â   #Aambala  Â   #Flower  Â   #HappyNewYear  Â   #Steelers  Â   #TransformationTuesday  Â   #CES2015  Â   #Evolution  Â   #TriviaTuesday  Â   #TacoTuesday  Â   #YearInReview  Â   #Malibu  Â   #TimesSquare  Â   #maldives  Â   #maldivesisland  Â  Â  Â   #beautifulisland  Â   #travel  Â   #vacationdestinations  Â   #vacation  Â   #HongKong  Â   #Night  Â   #China  Â   #Travel  Â   #Peak  Â   #Tram  Â   #victoriaharbor  Â   #Offline   #TheInterview  Â   #LizardSquad  Â   #Friday  Â   #Indonesia  Â   #Bokeh  Â   #DoctorWho  Â   #BoxingDay  Â   #Bestof2014  Â   #TGIF  Â  Â  Â   #SalmanKhan  Â  Â   #Caturday  Â  Â   #NewYear2015  Â  Â   #snowphotography  Â  Â   #Kerala  Â  Â   #SMS  Â  Â   #AUSvIND  Â  Â   #Flower  Â  Â  Â   #EXO  Â  Â   #Aambala   #DeniseMilani  Â   #LukeMilani  Â   #germanshepherd  Â   #gsd  Â Â  Â   #Christmas  Â   #dog  Â   #doglife  Â   #bestbuddies  Â   #love  Â   #animalfriends  Â   #SalmanKhan  Â   #Caturday  Â   #Kerala  Â   #NewYear2015  Â   #AUSvIND   #snowphotography  Â   #SMS  Â   #Aambala  Â   #Flower  ?  #NewYear2015  Â   #AirAsia  Â   #Offline  Â   #Dhoni  Â   #LeelahAlcorn  Â   #BYEBYE2014  Â   #WordlessWednesday  Â   #Ravens  Â   #FamilyDontEndWithBlood  Â   #Catoftheday  ï»¿"
