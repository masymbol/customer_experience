"1","The Border - Gavaskar Trophy 2014-15 has ended the way it started.The final day of the Test series at Sydney resembled the final day of the first Test at Adelaide. Turning pitch, Nathan Lyon, India with a score to chase. And all three results were possible at tea.The emotion of Phil Hughes was there in the first as well as the last game.This series had 4 captains on display and any mention of it without the mention of the younger two would be incomplete. Steve Smith and Virat Kohli were phenomenal.As the commentators were saying today, the series was far more competitive than the scoreline suggests. The only difference between the two teams was India&#39;s bowling. India&#39;s batsmen on the other hand played superbly in all the matches and displayed great fighting spirit. Australia also seized some of the crucial moments better, like one saw at the Gabba. They deserved to win the series.A good word to describe this series will be &#39;attritional&#39;. I will have a Test match and Test series hangover for the next two days. Some thing that I like to call &#39;Post Test match and post Test series syndrome&#39;.#Warner #Kohli #SteveSmith #Vijay #Lyon #Rahane #Harris #KLRahul #Hazlewood #RIPPhilHughes #AusvsInd #cricketï»¿"
