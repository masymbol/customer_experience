"2084",2,"Obama: âIâm Going to Play Offense.â+MaryKatharine Ham, Hot AirAccording to several sources at the Thursday summit in Baltimore, Obama vowed to defend his agenda against Republicans in Congress, promised to stand firm against GOP efforts to dismantle his agenda and called on his Democratic colleagues to help sustain his expected vetoes. The president also was explicit over his administrationâs opposition to an Iran sanctions bill, promising to veto legislation with his administration in the midst of multilateral nuclear negotiations with the Middle Eastern regime.Even though Obamaâs position on Iran sanctions differs from a number of powerful Democrats, the session, several sources said, was more of a pep rally than confrontation. Despite his lame-duck status, the president promised that he would not sit on the sidelines in the next two years. He vowed more executive actions to implement his agenda, something bound to prompt anger from Republicans who have called the presidentâs unilateral moves, particularly on immigration, an unconstitutional power grab.Read the whole thing (http://bit.ly/1Cud9TJ) #obama  #republicans  #iran -----ï»¿","https://plus.google.com/1.11043030970843e+20"
