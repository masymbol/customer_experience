"2110",-2,"Tweet: WOW... #Obama White House #supported the @CIA spying on the #Senate. CoS Denis McDonough needs firing now: http://huff.to/1yqGkYtThis is a real story. Dan Froomkin, formerly of The Washington Post now works at The Intercept. His story has it documented (http://bit.ly/1yqH1B5 ), but it isn&#39;t as easy to read, unfortunately, so I put that one in the tweet. The Huffington Post is ridiculously unreliable-- note that the very end of the piece contains a note that says, when translated:&quot;We originally said the White House had advance knowledge and gave the go-ahead to do this. After a few dozen people called us on this, we realized that CIA director John Brennan didn&#39;t  talk to White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough about this until after he was doing it.&quot; Meaning it was approval after the fact, not authorization beforehand. There is a difference.Of course, the Nixon White House didn&#39;t actually know what &quot;The Plumbers&quot; (named because they dealt with information leaks) were breaking into Democratic National Committee headquarters. But when the burglars got caught, the White House tried to crush the case, and Nixon ended up impeached.Also, because I forget that not everyone knows this stuff, the White House Chief of Staff is the second-highest ranking official in the White House. If you think of the President as the Chief Executive Officer of the country, the WHCOS (or CoS, as he is referred to) is the Chief Operating Officer. He&#39;s &quot;Assistant President&quot;-- when he tells you to do something, he is always assumed to be speaking on behalf of the President.So, yes, this is a big deal. Big as it gets. When the second-in-command of the executive branch is told that the secret police is spying on the legislative and doesn&#39;t stop it on the spot, it&#39;s the element of a coup.
