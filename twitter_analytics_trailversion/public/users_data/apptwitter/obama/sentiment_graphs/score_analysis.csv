"2075",-7,"The U.S. Fight Against Jihadism Has Lost Its Momentum+Washington PostÂ PRESIDENT OBAMAâS neglect of the anti-terrorism march in Paris seemed reflective of a broader loss of momentum by his administration in combating Islamic jihadism. Five months after the president launched military operations against the Islamic State, fighting in Iraq and Syria appears stalemated. The training of Iraqi army units for a hoped-for counteroffensive is proceeding slowly and, according to a report by The Postâs Loveday Morris, looks under-resourced. Weapons and ammunition are in such short supply that trainees are yelling âbang, bangâ in place of shooting.Iraq, moreover, is the theater where U.S. engagement is most aggressive; elsewhere, the Obama administration appears to be passively standing by as jihadists expand their territory, recruitment and training. In Libya, the job of stemming an incipient civil war has been left to a feckless U.N. mediator, even though the Islamic State is known to be operating at least one training camp with hundreds of recruits. In Nigeria, where a new offensive by the Boko Haram movement has overrun much of one northeastern state, a U.S. military training program was recently canceled by the government following a dispute over arms sales.The bankruptcy of U.S. policy toward the Syrian civil war was underlined again on Wednesday, when Secretary of State John F. Kerry expressed hope for a patently cynical and one-sided diplomatic initiative by Russia, which has been working to preserve the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Itâs been nearly a year since the last U.S. diplomatic effort to end the war collapsed, and the administration continues to offer no strategy for how to stop the regimeâs assaults on moderate Syrian forces it is counting on to fight the Islamic State. It has ignored widespread assessments that its program for training Syrian forces is too small and too slow.Read the whole thing (http://wapo.st/1C7MkXc)Below:Â Iraqi Shi&#39;ite fighters keep watch during fighting with Islamic State militants at Al-Nibai, north of Baghdad,January 14, 2015.

"2084",2,"Obama: âIâm Going to Play Offense.â+MaryKatharine Ham, Hot AirAccording to several sources at the Thursday summit in Baltimore, Obama vowed to defend his agenda against Republicans in Congress, promised to stand firm against GOP efforts to dismantle his agenda and called on his Democratic colleagues to help sustain his expected vetoes. The president also was explicit over his administrationâs opposition to an Iran sanctions bill, promising to veto legislation with his administration in the midst of multilateral nuclear negotiations with the Middle Eastern regime.Even though Obamaâs position on Iran sanctions differs from a number of powerful Democrats, the session, several sources said, was more of a pep rally than confrontation. Despite his lame-duck status, the president promised that he would not sit on the sidelines in the next two years. He vowed more executive actions to implement his agenda, something bound to prompt anger from Republicans who have called the presidentâs unilateral moves, particularly on immigration, an unconstitutional power grab.Read the whole thing (http://bit.ly/1Cud9TJ) #obama  #republicans  #iran -----ï»¿"

"2110",-2,"Tweet: WOW... #Obama White House #supported the @CIA spying on the #Senate. CoS Denis McDonough needs firing now: http://huff.to/1yqGkYtThis is a real story. Dan Froomkin, formerly of The Washington Post now works at The Intercept. His story has it documented (http://bit.ly/1yqH1B5 ), but it isn&#39;t as easy to read, unfortunately, so I put that one in the tweet. The Huffington Post is ridiculously unreliable-- note that the very end of the piece contains a note that says, when translated:&quot;We originally said the White House had advance knowledge and gave the go-ahead to do this. After a few dozen people called us on this, we realized that CIA director John Brennan didn&#39;t  talk to White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough about this until after he was doing it.&quot; Meaning it was approval after the fact, not authorization beforehand. There is a difference.Of course, the Nixon White House didn&#39;t actually know what &quot;The Plumbers&quot; (named because they dealt with information leaks) were breaking into Democratic National Committee headquarters. But when the burglars got caught, the White House tried to crush the case, and Nixon ended up impeached.Also, because I forget that not everyone knows this stuff, the White House Chief of Staff is the second-highest ranking official in the White House. If you think of the President as the Chief Executive Officer of the country, the WHCOS (or CoS, as he is referred to) is the Chief Operating Officer. He&#39;s &quot;Assistant President&quot;-- when he tells you to do something, he is always assumed to be speaking on behalf of the President.So, yes, this is a big deal. Big as it gets. When the second-in-command of the executive branch is told that the secret police is spying on the legislative and doesn&#39;t stop it on the spot, it&#39;s the element of a coup.
